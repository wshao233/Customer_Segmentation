Project: Identify Customer SegmentsÂ¶
By creating customer segmentation and comparing to general population, one can know which part of the general population are more likely to be customer and which part are not. I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it to demographics information for the general population.

Here I used different approaches to pre-process the data, and then I used unsupervised learning techniques, PCA (Principle Componets Analysis) and k-NN (k-nearest neighbor algorithm), to perform customer segmentation and to identify the core customer traits of the company.
